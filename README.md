**Messages Store** is a custom Home Assistant component designed to store, manage, and retrieve messages in a SQLite database. Whether it's for TTS messages, mobile notifications, Telegram alerts, or other applications, this component allows you to dynamically handle text data across various automation scenarios. You can easily add, edit, delete, and retrieve messages.

## Features
- **[UI Panel](#ui-panel)**: A user-friendly interface is available in the Home Assistant sidebar under "Messages Store," where you can list, search, edit, delete, and add messages.
- **State Replacement:** Automatically replace `(state:entity_id)` tags in messages with the current state of the specified Home Assistant entity, including the unit of measurement if available.
- **Slug Replacement:** Replace `(slug:slug_name)` tags in messages with the corresponding message stored under that slug, allowing for dynamic message construction.
- **Placeholder Replacement:** Dynamically replace `%s` placeholders in messages with values provided when retrieving the message, allowing for customizable and flexible messaging.

## Services

### 1. `messages_store.add_message`

**Description:** Adds a new message.

**Service Data:**

- `slug` (required): A unique identifier for the message.
- `message` (required): The message to be stored. Can be a string or a list of strings.

**Example:**

```yaml
service: messages_store.add_message
data:
  slug: "greeting_message"
  message: "Hello, welcome to %s, %s!"
```

**Example 2, multiple messages in slug:**

```yaml
service: messages_store.add_message
data:
  slug: "greeting_message"
  message: 
    - "Hello, welcome to %s, %s!"
    - "Welcome to %s %s !!"
```

**Example 3, advanced usage with slug tags:**

```yaml
service: messages_store.add_message
data:
  slug: "welcome_message"
  message: "Welcome to our service! (slug:greeting_message)"
```

**Explanation:**

- The message stored with the `slug` of `welcome_message` contains a reference to another message using the tag `(slug:greeting_message)`.
- When `welcome_message` is retrieved using the `get_message` service, the `(slug:greeting_message)` will be replaced with the corresponding message if it doesn't contain circular references.

**Example 4, advanced usage with state entity tags:**

```yaml
service: messages_store.add_message
data:
  slug: "welcome_message"
  message: "Welcome to our service! (state:sensor.temperature)"
```

**Explanation:**

- The message stored with the slug of welcome_message contains a reference to the current state of a Home Assistant entity using the tag `(state:sensor.temperature)`.
- When welcome_message is retrieved using the get_message service, the `(state:sensor.temperature)` tag will be replaced with the current state value of the `sensor.temperature` entity, including its unit of measurement, if available.

**Response:**

```yaml
status: true
message: Message added with slug welcome_message
```

### 2. `messages_store.get_message`

**Description:** Retrieves a message by its slug, with optional placeholder replacements.

**Service Data:**

- `slug` (required): The identifier of the message to retrieve.
- `replace` (optional): A list of values to replace placeholders (`%s`) in the message.
- `filter` (optional): Use `random` to retrieve a random message from the list.

**Example:**

```yaml
service: messages_store.get_message
data:
  slug: "greeting_message"
  replace:
    - "Home Assistant"
    - "John"
```

**Response:**

```yaml
status: true
message: 
  - Hello, welcome to Home Assistant, John!
  - Welcome to Home Assistant John !!
```

**Example 2, using state replacement:**

```yaml
service: messages_store.get_message
data:
  slug: "welcome_message"
```

**Response 2:**

```yaml
status: true
message: 
  - "Welcome to our service! 10Â°"
```

### 3. `messages_store.edit_message`

**Description:** Edits an existing message.

**Service Data:**

**Example:**

```yaml
service: messages_store.edit_message
data:
  slug: "greeting_message"
  message: "Hello, welcome to the Home Assistant community!"
```

**Response:**

```yaml
status: true
message: "Message updated for slug greeting_message"
```

### 4. `messages_store.delete_message`

**Description:** Deletes a message by slug.

**Service Data:**

- `slug` (required): The identifier of the message to delete.

**Example:**

```yaml
service: messages_store.delete_message

  slug: "greeting_message"
```

**Response:**

```yaml
status: true
message: "Message deleted for slug greeting_message"
```

### 5. `messages_store.get_messages`

**Description:** Retrieves multiple messages with optional filtering and placeholder replacements.

**Service Data:**

- `filter` (optional): A list of filters. Each filter is a dictionary with `slug` and optional `replace` fields. You can also use the `random` filter to retrieve a random message.

**Example:**

```yaml
service: messages_store.get_messages
data:
  filter:
    - slug: "greeting_message"
      replace:
        - "Home Assistant"
        - "John"
    - slug: "farewell_message"
      replace:
        - "Mary"
```

**Response:**

```yaml
status: true
data: 
  - slug: greeting_message
    message: 
      - Hello, welcome to Home Assistant, John!
  - slug: farewell_message
    message: 
      - Goodbye, Mary. See you next time!
```

**Example 2:**

**Example:**

```yaml
service: messages_store.add_bulk_messages
data:
  closed_window_office_rain:
    - "It's raining and the office window is open"
    - "Close the office window because it's raining"
  alert_bedroom_climate_on_opened_door:
    - "I turned off the air conditioning because the door is open"
```

**Response:**

```yaml
status: true
message: "Successfully inserted slugs: closed_window_office_rain, alert_bedroom_climate_on_opened_door"
```

## Development Environment Setup

This repository includes a pre-configured development container (devcontainer) for use with GitHub Codespaces or VS Code Remote - Containers. This provides a consistent and fully set up environment for developing and testing this custom component.

### Using GitHub Codespaces

1.  Navigate to the main page of this repository on GitHub.
2.  Click the green "Code" button.
3.  Select the "Codespaces" tab.
4.  Click "Create codespace on main" (or your current branch). GitHub will then set up the Codespace, which may take a few minutes.
5.  Once ready, VS Code will open in your browser, or you can open it in your local VS Code application. The environment will be automatically configured based on the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.

### Using VS Code Remote - Containers (Local)

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.
    *   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.
    *   The [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed in VS Code.
2.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git # Replace with actual repo URL
    cd your-repository-name # Replace with actual repo directory
    ```
3.  **Open in Container**:
    *   Open VS Code.
    *   Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
    *   Type and select: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
    *   VS Code will build the dev container image (if not already built) and start the container. This might take several minutes on the first run.

### What's Included?

The development container comes with:

*   Python 3.13+
*   Home Assistant Core (installed via `requirements_dev.txt`)
*   `uv` for fast package management
*   Pre-configured VS Code extensions for Python development (Ruff, Pylint, Pylance), YAML, Prettier, and GitHub Copilot.
*   Linters and formatters set up (Ruff, Prettier).
*   A Home Assistant `config` directory ready for use.
*   The custom component from this repository mounted into the `/config/custom_components` directory of the Home Assistant instance within the container.

### Running Home Assistant

*   Once the devcontainer is up and running, Home Assistant should start automatically as part of the `postStartCommand`.
*   If you need to start it manually or if it was stopped, open a terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal) and run:
    ```bash
    hass -c config
    ```
*   You can access the Home Assistant web interface at [http://localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123) in your browser.

### Development Workflow

1.  Make your code changes in the `custom_components/messages_store/` directory.
2.  The changes will be reflected live in the running Home Assistant instance due to the bind mount. You may need to restart Home Assistant (via the Developer Tools > Server Management in HA UI, or by restarting the `hass` command) for some changes to take effect.
3.  Use the integrated terminal for Git commands, running tests, etc.
